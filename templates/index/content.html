        <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Historical bicycles are more than means of transportation – they reflect engineering skill, cultural shifts,
            and
            artistic value. These machines, developed since the early 19th century, carry the stories of their time on
            their
            frames. From simple wooden bikes with solid wheels to sophisticated steel frames of the 70s and 80s – every
            era
            brought advancements that shaped cycling.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Heritage and Innovation</h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
        <p>In the 20th century, especially between 1970 and 1990, cycling became not just a sport but a lifestyle. Bikes
            from this period are valued for their combination of craftsmanship and functionality. Steel frames,
            hand-brazed
            joints, unique geometries, and innovative components turned vintage bicycles into treasures that still hold
            high
            value today.</p>

        <p>Bikes from this era were used not only for racing but also for recreational cycling. Brands like Bianchi,
            Peugeot, and Colnago were industry leaders, each bringing something unique. The most notable was the Italian
            brand Colnago, whose bold innovations and aesthetic sense influenced the entire cycling world.</p>
