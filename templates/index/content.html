        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sat-l" >In the 20th century, especially between 1970 and 1990, cycling became not just a sport but a lifestyle. Bikes
            from this period are valued for their combination of craftsmanship and functionality. Steel frames,
            hand-brazed
            joints, unique geometries, and innovative components turned vintage bicycles into treasures that still hold
            high
            value today.</p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-sat-l">Bikes from this era were used not only for racing but also for recreational cycling. Brands like Bianchi,
            Peugeot, and Colnago were industry leaders, each bringing something unique. The most notable was the Italian
            brand Colnago, whose bold innovations and aesthetic sense influenced the entire cycling world.</p>
